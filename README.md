### A modified example for using a webcam for the latest mediapipe (early release) hand landmark detection.
Note: This is a barely running example, just to show how to use a webcam with mediapipe. The C wrappers are quite annoying to get into and luckily there was an example on
how to convert a cv2 frame to a mediapipe compatible one.

## Usage:
Just do ```pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy``` and you should be good to go.
