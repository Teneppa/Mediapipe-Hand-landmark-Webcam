### A modified example for using a webcam with the latest MediaPipe (early release) hand landmark detection.
Note: This is a basic example, intended only to demonstrate how to use a webcam with MediaPipe. The C wrappers can be somewhat challenging to work with, but fortunately, there is an example on how to convert a cv2 frame to a MediaPipe compatible format.

## Usage:
Just do ```pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy``` and you should be good to go.
